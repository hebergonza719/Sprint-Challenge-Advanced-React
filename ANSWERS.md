- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

Class components can use react lifecycle and state methods.


- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

a) componentDidMount – this method runs as soon as the render method runs the very first time. The main purpose of this method is to call a fetch request.

b) componentDidUpdate – this method runs once the Dom has been updated. 

c) componentWillUnmount – this method runs before the app closes. It cleans up everything related to component.


- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

Custom hooks are re-usable. They are also very versatile; they can be used 	for handling controlled inputs, to managing event listeners, or watching for key presses.
 

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?

Testing is essential for quality control. Testing reduces the risk of bugs in our software. Testing is not optional, it should be implemented in all development workflow. It saves money because it could be more costly to implement manual testing during the later phases of development.
